# Student grade

Create a function that asks the user to input student marks within the range of 0 to 100. The function should then determine and output the corresponding grade based on specified criteria: A for marks greater than 79, B for marks between 60 and 79, C for marks between 50 and 59, D for marks between 40 and 49, and E for marks less than 40.

# speed

This program takes the speed of a car as input, compares it with the speed limit, and calculates demerit points based on the given rules. If the speed is less than or equal to the speed limit, it prints "Ok." Otherwise, it calculates demerit points for every 5 km/s above the speed limit and prints the total demerit points. If the total demerit points exceed 12, it prints "License suspended."
